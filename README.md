Thank you for teaching me a lot about programming!
I was able to learn a lot even with Xavier and Joey in my group.
The STEM Project was especially fun to work on, even though we didn't really get a good project done.
I also enjoyed learning about Java and how to code it. It is too bad that I could not have continued learning GitHub, I was starting to like it.
In conclusion, I am very glad to have taken programming this year.
Thank you for being a great programming teacher.

Sincerely,
Parker Hong
